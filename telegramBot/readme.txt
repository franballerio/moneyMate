This is your personal finance friend "Money Mate"


The problem started when i got my first job, which means that i could have my own credit card.
But my bank’s app was a disaster and till now i cannot see which were my spending.
The idea of this project is that you can track your expenses in an easy way.
Just chatting with the bot you can add expenses, get a month’s balance, etc
